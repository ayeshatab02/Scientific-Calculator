# Scientific-Calculator
#Description : Here, we are making a scientific calculator using Python and Tkinter GUI library.This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations along with advanced functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, and other mathematical operations.

##Features:
1.Basic Operations:
i.Addition
ii.Subtraction
iii.Multiplication
iv.Division


2.Advanced Functions:
i.Trigonometric: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)
ii.Logarithmic: log(x) (logarithm base 10), ln(x) 
iii.Exponential & Power: e^x
iv.Absolute Value: abs(x)
v.Factorial: x!
vi.Modulus: x % y
vii.Square Root (√)


##Installation:
Before running the program, make sure Python and Tkinter are installed.
Install Python: 
If Python is not installed on your system, download and install it from the official Python website.

Tkinter is included by default with Python, so there is no need to install it separately.


##Usage:
Download the Project: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

Running the Program:Open your terminal or IDE. Navigate to the folder where scientific_calculator.py is saved.


Run the program using the following command: python scientific_calculator.py


##Example:
Example 1: To calculate 5 + 3 (basic operations):
Enter 5 in "Number 1"
Enter 3 in "Number 2"
Click Add

Example 2: To calculate the square root of 16(advanced operations):
Enter 16 in "Number 1"
Enter 2 in "Number 2" (for square root)
Click Root


Example 3: To calculate the sine of 30°(advanced operations):
Enter 30 in "Number 1"
Leave "Number 2" empty
Click sin(x)


##Requirements:
Python: Version 3.x or higher

Tkinter: Comes pre-installed with Python, so no separate installation is required.
